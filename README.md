# HANCOOL

Hancool is an application (made for perseonal use) to aid in my studying and learning of Korean

The name is a play on words. 한글 which is the Korean word for the writing system is pronounded "han-gewl", thus, "han-cool".

The back-end communicates with a local MySQL server where all the data for the words are stored
